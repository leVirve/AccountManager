Colleac
==============

Colleac save accounts information in local computer.

  - Local storage database
  - Account information will be encrypted
  - AES-256 encryption and SHA hash

> [AES] [1] is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001

Demo Version

Tech
-----------

Colleac uses open source libraries ( Python packages ):

* [Python] - ( this poject base on python3 )
* [PyCrypto] - awesome collection of secure hash functions and encryption algorithms
* [SQLite3] - provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process

##### Encryption Used

```
    'Database': protected by an SHA-2(SHA512) hashed key
    'Account Entries': before saving, password will be encrypted by AES 256
```

##### Instructions
